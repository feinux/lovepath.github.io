## I can't forget

I can't forget what you said when we met first time. You were in a white long skirt, light reflected from your lips like you just finished your breakfast right minute ago. 

But that moment, so we call Zing! 

I did not remember exactly, but then, I fell in love with you. It was so sweet, so warm in heart, so tender, feeling so good!

## I can't let go

Life is hard, like the song named "life is struggle". We are both young and childish, tho not bold. So many tears and arguments, shouts and fights. You said you can't take it anymore, you said you want me let you go. 

But I can't, and I didn't. 

## I can't be so happy, without you

Love, lasts, endless.
